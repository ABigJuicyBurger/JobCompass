Mar 1

- Set up react + dependencies
  \_ create vite @ latest -- --template react
  \_ npm init y (redundant due to ^)
  \_ npm install axios cors dotenv express knex mysql2 react-router-dom sass

  - setup basic browser router, routes, route

- Help create DB

  - look at @joblistcreation.sql (connect to DB, create DB, then npx knex init)
    \_switch default file to export module with mysql2 connection and the payload (knexfile.js)

  - create migration file
    \_npx knex migrate:make create_job_postings

    - up: create ; down: delete
    - edit migration file (check migrations folder)
      \_ now contains relevant job info

  - create tables!
    \_ npx knex migrate:latest (like up)

    - to drop: npx knex migrate:rollback

  - seed data
    \_ npx knex seed:make jobs-data (makes seeds folder)
    \_ in seeds folder import the data and just use DB name
    \_ make folder name of seed-data and put the imported data in export default file

  Mar 03

  - execute seed files and add to DB
    \_ npx knex seed:run
    \_ lets script some of these codes:

    - "migrate": "knex migrate:latest",
    - "migrate:down": "knex migrate:down",
    - "migrate:rollback": "knex migrate:rollback",
    - "seed": "knex seed:run"
      \_ also install nodemon to watch for changes

  - DB stuff done! Now some basic routing and querying with Express
    \_ set up index.js file with .env, express and instantiate it with port
    \_ run it with node index.js
    - tomorrow set up a route and create it; initKnex config and fetch that data :0

March 04

- Route setting
  \_ imported initknex and configuration
  \_ make an instancee of knex with initknex(config)
  \_ setup route for jobs and link to jobsroutes
  \_ jobsroutes has router using express and gets a route and uses controller
  \_ the controller does stuff (like handle requests)

  March 05

- we got jobs: now let's start the front end
  \_ play around with google maps
  \_ Get api key from site (https://visgl.github.io/react-google-maps/docs/get-started)
  \_ Map is functional and shows on page centerd in calgary with a bit of space around it to showw the job card selected
  \*\*\*\* Need to show job markers eventually w/ basic tooltips (AI HELPED HERE)

  March 06
  \_ return data with axios request; now i need to form a job card (tomorrow me)

  march 08
  \_ start with a job card and see how it looks!
  \_ looks horrible! but all data is successfuly sent so just need to style ( :)

  March 10

  - do a little job card styling during learning studio
    \_ install date-fns and use it to format date from disgusting ISP 8601
    \_ little job card styling done! \*\*\*\ still need some logic like saving + apply, will look at once done job list
  - job list done! for last hour of day will incorporate a bit of TS
    \_ npm i -g typescript
    \_ create tsconfig file w/ tsc --init
    \_ create a type object for jobCard with its shape
    \_ use it where needed in the state "storage", mention what im returning JSX,
    mention what other status should return, mention what methods are returning,
    and adjust tsconfig to return JSX.
    - Will learn to type as i go
    - to prevent complications let me summarize:
      \_ created type definition modeling shape of job data
      \_ defined types for properties of this job
      \_ exported it
      \_ imported it to jobcard and added return type to component (JSX.Element)
      \_ type state hooks with generics (<JobCardType | null> and <Boolean>)
      \_ added promise return type to async fnxn (: Promise<void>)
      \_ : is annotate type and <> is generic type (definite type vs conditional type)
  - for now let's create a job list container which can link to particular job
    \_ practiced types in joblist too, had to import JSX + npm i types/react
    in order for TS to find namespace JSX
    \_ and made an interface for .env so TS understands Vite
  -

March 12

- got the okay for capstone + completed capstone proposal
- lost .env files when switching branches! made a new one and locally saved it this time
- Leaked the api key! went through a coaster using bfg repo-cleaner and java to remove all instances of it in github + rotated apikey to prevent someone snatching it and using it
  \_ creater mirror cloen with a replacement txt file, ran BFG w/ Java to find+replace data in commit history, used git reflog and gc to clean up referencees
- Next, typed the home page and fixed API key by importing starting with VITE
  \_ now im conditionally rendering baseed on screen size: everything after mobile shows the map/list function
- Now i need to show the map (success) with advanced markers (of each job) with corresponding pin
  \_ first i need to set a map id (google api requirement, represents styling and configs i have)

March 13

- Styled maps with maps api
- show a single card through user click on marker (which i need to style) by saving click in a state var and conditionally rendering the mapcard or an extension of jobcard which accepts a prop which changes url path (where default is just the browser search of url which uses params)
  \_ wow that was wordy

March 15

- Positioned Job Card within the map with absolute positioning and z index
- added restriction bounds within the map to restrict map movement to anything outside of calgary

March 17

- Make URL show up in jobcard; this is neeede in job map (as card shows conditionally in the map)
  by using navigate
- Adjust type of props being passed from Map -> card -> note (which is basically an extension of jobCard)
  \_ separate jobnote to its own component that is the "opposite" side of the card
  \_ typed note with map job card as they come together like a marriage
  \_ quickyl implemented a simple login and register component
  \*\*\* will need to clean up pages folder! as that will be my finalized product
  \_ got so stressed as passing props up causes a llot of TS issues so ihad to make sure my prop names were A correct, B being passed right and C being typed appropriately
  \_ current prop passing note flow is App.tsx -> JobMap.tsx -> MapJobCard.tsx -> JobCard.tsx &&
  App.tsx to JobNote.tsx

  - added a "under construction" page for login and register, cleaned up styling for
    main page, and added logic to conditionally render list or map on phone mode (tiny)
  - got note functionality working!

  March 19

  - today i will focus on mobile styling where its eitheer map or joblist; can't do both!
    \_ cleaned up jobcard so its on the sidee past mobile screens and at the bottom in mobile mode
  - added logic to check mobile size with window event listener with 'resize'; if it crosses mobile size
    then some styling changes occur including button that shows up in header to toggle between map or job
  - cleaned up pathway so that individual jobs show on mobile state as well
  - NOW i need to focus on marker API styling (on load show job; hover show company and salary)
    \*\*\* priority is computer over mobile

  March 20

  - today im using a state var to check if im hovering on job; if i am ill use the hovered id to match the marker selected and style it
    \_ only fancy thing used is in job map i have to check if its hovered and if the id matches the hovered id
  - I also crossed out anything not done yet (crudding users and the saved jobs; saved jobs may take priority now)
  - for now ill clean up my folders and ill also start a saved jobs route: for guest mode.
    \_ have a guest user on click immediately that gets wiped out on tab close (maybe a cookie?)

  - tonight maybe try the "roulette" state where i show 10 jobs at first, and every 6-10 seconds i add a new job and every 8-12 seconds i delete a job to emulate a "live" server
    \_ or maybe, for fun....
    -i shouldn't "surprise" the user; they want a clean UX with consistency and not really gamify it

  March 21

  - Today I'll focus on deployment so i Have a live app that can be accessible!
    \_ will use AWS EC2
    \_ create a budget
    \_ ubuntu server
    \_ start ~/.ssh to save key locally
    \_ grab the Ipv4 from my instance

    -log into the EC2 instance with SSH
    \_ $ cd ~/.ssh
    Then, execute the following command:
    $ ssh -i <PEM_FILE_NAME> ubuntu@<SERVER_IPV4_ADDRESS>

    - connected!

    * curl already installed
    * install node :
      \_ curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_23.x -o nodesource_setup.sh (setup script)
      \_ sudo -E bash nodesource_setup.sh (run script)
      \_ sudo apt-get install -y nodejs (install node)
      - verify with node -v
    * install PM2, process manager to keep node running
      \_ $ sudo npm i -g pm2
    * setup github ssh to transfer files over to EC2
      \_ ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
      \_ with that cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
      \_ send it over to github and add it
      \_ now ssh -T git@github.com to verify
      = Connected!
    * folder on EC2 to store app files
      \_ mkdir ~/repos
      clone my repo from git -> npm i both client & server
      - npm i both ends and run production version with npm run build on front end
      - started express server w/ pm2 start index.js and pm2 save && pm2 startup to start on reboot
    * now to create .env (need to be safe)
      \_ nano .env
      \_ put backend info first
    * now to set up frotn end
    * first use nginx so that it serves my front end appropriately and protect my backend port
      \_ sudo apt update && sudo apt install nginx
      \_ check if successful: systemctl status nginx
      \_ instead of editing the default Nginx config, create a separte config file
      = sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/jobcompass
      \_ add our config =
      = server {
      listen 80;
      server_name your-ec2-ip-address;

          # Serve frontend static files
          location / {
              root /home/ubuntu/repos/JobCompass/client/dist;
              try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html;
              index index.html;
          }

          # Forward API requests to Express backend
          location /jobs {
              proxy_pass http://localhost:8080;
              proxy_http_version 1.1;
              proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
              proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
              proxy_set_header Host $host;
              proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
          }

      }

  - then ctrl o (save) -> enter -> ctrl x
  - now enable my config as it's not the default!
    \_ sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/jobcompass /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
    \_ sudo rm /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default # Remove default config
  - now test if it works: sudo nginx -t
  - then restart

  - now set up front end .env slightly differently usign the ec2 instance
    \_ VITE_BACKEND_URL=http://your-ec2-ip-address
    VITE_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your-maps-api-key

  - finally run npm run build

  - and launch! didnt work
  - nginx doesnt have permission to access front end.

    ## Updating Existing Deployment

    ```markdown
    ### When Deploying Updates:

    1. **Pull Changes**:
      ```bash
      cd ~/repos/JobCompass
      git pull origin main
    ````

    2. **Update Backend** (if needed):

    ```bash
    cd server
    npm install  # Only if package.json changed

    # Only if you added database migrations:
    npx knex migrate:latest

    # Only if you need to update seed data (caution: may overwrite existing data):
    npx knex seed:run

    # Restart server:
    pm2 restart all
    ```

    3. **Update Frontend**:

    ```bash
    cd ../client
    npm install  # Only if package.json changed
    npm run build
    sudo cp -R dist/* /var/www/jobcompass/
    ```

    ````

    ## Troubleshooting Common Issues

    ```markdown
    ### Common Issues:

    1. **"MySQL Connection Refused"**:
      - Check if MySQL is running: `sudo systemctl status mysql`
      - If not running: `sudo systemctl start mysql`
      - Verify credentials in .env match what you set up

    2. **Build Permission Errors**:
      - Fix ownership: `sudo chown -R ubuntu:ubuntu ~/repos/JobCompass/client/dist`

    3. **"404 Not Found" on Frontend**:
      - Check Nginx config: `sudo nginx -t`
      - Verify files were copied: `ls -la /var/www/jobcompass/`

    4. **Missing Images/Assets**:
      - Use relative paths in production:
        - Import directly: `import logo from '../../assets/logo.png'`
        - Or use public folder: `src="/assets/logo.png"` (and place in public folder)

    5. **500 Server Errors**:
      - Check PM2 logs: `pm2 logs`
      - Verify database connection in server logs

    6. **CORS Issues**:
      - Ensure CORS_ORIGIN doesn't have trailing slashes
      - For development, use: `CORS_ORIGIN=*`

    7. **Quick Verification Steps**:
      - Test API: `curl http://localhost:8080/jobs`
      - Check server: `pm2 status`
      - Check web server: `systemctl status nginx`
    ````

  - hefty but done.

  - now ill start a new feature: a user
